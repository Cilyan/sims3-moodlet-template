<!-- For Buffs, the beginning of the key (before the colon) is important. You need to keep it
     For example, the key for your buff name should be "Gameplay/Excel/buffs/BuffList:" and then
     the reference you gave in the buff XML file. -->

<!-- Name of the buff in the game -->
<KEY>Gameplay/Excel/buffs/BuffList:Template.TplBuff.BuffTest</KEY>
<STR>Under test</STR>

<!-- Description of the buff in the game -->
<KEY>Gameplay/Excel/buffs/BuffList:Template.TplBuff.BuffTest.Description</KEY>
<STR>Any sim likes to be under test. They feel important.</STR>

<!-- Don't really know, but same as description is OK -->
<KEY>Gameplay/Excel/buffs/BuffList:BuffList:Template.TplBuff.BuffTest.FPD</KEY>
<STR>Any sim likes to be under test. They feel important.</STR>

<!-- Description of the origin (reason) -->
<!-- Like for name and description, always starts with "Gameplay/Excel/buffs/BuffOrigins:"
     then, use the same string you used when calling your moodlet (the second parameter of
     AddElement). If you want to use Twallan's STBL, you do not have access (currently)
     to the FNV() function. You will need to compute it yourself (S3PE) and put it here
     without the leading "0x". In this case, that would give
     "Gameplay/Excel/buffs/BuffOrigins:252433B0A5E3156C" -->
<KEY>Gameplay/Excel/buffs/BuffOrigins:FNV(Template.TplBuff.MyOrigin)</KEY>
<STR>(Reason: Is under test)</STR>

<!-- You can have your other strings here. -->
<KEY>Template/TplBuff/BuffTestInteraction:TestBuff</KEY>
<STR>Test Moodlet</STR>
